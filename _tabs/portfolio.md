My portfolio is distributed across multiple providers and accounts. Most of the projects are private, but some of them are open source.

Some of my older personal projects are on Bitbucket under my 'business name', BaBeStudios. The name comes from my wife's and my family names.

On Github I have a mix of older and newer projects and job search test assignments. Also my personal blog on github.io.

## FlickSlate

My main project to try new Kotlin and Android features, mainly Android Architecture (both data and UI) and Compose.

## Companies House

My previous main project to try new language features and Kotlin Multiplatform. It uses MVI architecture through MVIKotlin and Decompose. THe iOS part is only partially finished due to a refocus on Android.
