My portfolio is distributed across multiple providers and accounts.

## Bitbucket/BaBeStudios

My personal projects are on Bitbucket under my 'business name', BaBeStudios. The name comes from my wife's and my family names.
Most of the projects are private, but some of them are open source.

### Companies House

My main project to try new language features.

### BaBeStudiosBase

A library split into four parts, allowing code reuse across projects.

## Github/herrbert74

Some of my older projects and newer job search test assignments. Also hosts my personal blog on github.io.

### FlickSlate
