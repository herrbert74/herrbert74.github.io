## Summary

Android developer since 2011. Have better than average skills in architecture and modularisation improvements, Android and general coding best practices, Gradle and Dagger. Can handle the whole development lifecycle and can lead others.
I’m passionate about clean and maintainable code, so I often take extra time to clean up what other people can't notice, like bad formatting, code duplication, and other hidden costs.
Tech used recently: Kotlin, MVI, Coroutines, SOLID, Dagger/Hilt, RetroFit, Jetpack Components, Modularisation, JUnit, Espresso, GraphQL, RxJava. On a hobby level: Jetpack Compose, Kotlin Multiplatform, iOS and SwiftUi.

## Experiences

![daily-mirror](/assets/img/resume/daily-mirror.png){: width="167" height="62" .left }
### Reach plc, London
#### Senior Android developer, February 2021 – January 2024

* I worked on the 50+ news applications, where the main challenge was making the design system and the build system work with all the variants, and keeping the build times to a minimum.
* Tech used: Kotlin, Dagger, MVI, MVIKotlin, JUnit, Espresso, Mockk, Realm, Coroutines, Bitbucket
* My duties:
  * Develop new features to documentation.
  * Code reviews and merge requests.
  * Apply and enforce the use of a custom Material 2 design system.
  * Helping junior members of the team with advice, reviews and documentation.
* The extra mile™: things that nobody asked for, but I did anyway, often in my free time
  * Many migrations: Java to Kotlin, RxJava to Coroutines, SQLite to Realm,  manual to Dagger dependency injection.
  * Architectural updates: modularisation, introducing MVIKotlin library.
  * Initiated a weekly technical catch up meeting to discuss technical challenges.
  * Became the go to developer on a few topics: design systems, Dagger injection, product variants, modularisation.
  * Introduced many useful tools, such as Detekt, Gradle Version Catalog, plus many other Java tools and libraries replaced with Kotlin equivalents.
  * I documented every aspect of our processes from Dagger how-tos, naming conventions and Design guidelines to the PR process.
  * As usual, I cleaned up the code regularly: I removed duplications, unused code and resources, removed Lint and build warnings, fixed style warnings. The code went up from 80k Lines Of Code to 100k LOC during my tenure, but my estimate is that it would be at around 180k without my work, making it significantly costlier to maintain.
* Agile environment: open ended sprints, code reviews, sprint planning, retrospectives

### Intelligent Environments (ieDigital), Kingston upon Thames
#### Android developer, May 2013 - March 2017

* Financial Services industry. We had one very large and complicated white label app, and we customised it for our clients. I worked on both, mainly as part of agile scrum teams.
* On the white label app:
  * Led the migration from Eclipse to Android Studio and introduced Artifactory to our project which led to the adoption of it by the whole company. Also improved the TeamCity build process.
  * Optimised our large Android Studio project with more than forty libraries to build relatively quickly.
  * Worked on a lot of new features and changes like server credentials login, sign in from third party app, pattern login or material design.
  * Customised our app to include Emoji sign in, what became quite famous:
  [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33063344][IE Emoji app]
  * Ensured PCI security standard compliance.
* In client delivery projects (mostly parallel to the white label work):
  * Liaised with QA, Business Analysts and Project Managers to ensure customer satisfaction. Became the sole source of information regarding Android development and technical feasibility.
  * Customised our mobile financial services platform according to specification. This includes mainly changing colours and copy text, but also adding new features like Apply for Thinkmoney.
  * Worked on an Android middleware for Atom Bank.
  * I was the sole developer for the first deployments of the company on Google Store for clients like CapitalOne, ING and Swisscard.
  * Streamlined the development and the build process.
  * Agile environment: usually Kanban boards, frequent CRs from clients, feedback to the white label app.
* Agile environment: two weeks sprints, code reviews, sprint planning, retrospectives
* App links: I’m afraid the links to Google Play are not relevant anymore.
* Other technologies used: RoboGuice, TeamCity, Artifactory, Crashlytics, Google Maps API, Google Analytics, GCM Messaging

### British Logo Quiz and Indian Logo Quiz
#### 2013 - Present (but outdated)

* These are based on the Hungarian Logo Quiz. I paid a commission to Synthesis-NET, because I wanted to continue the success with other languages.
* Used a common library project for these apps. They are built with Jenkins + Ant and can have multidimensional flavours like app stores (Google Play, Amazon Store, SlideMe. etc), ad networks (AdMob, Amazon, Samsung), etc. Later the build system was changed to Teamcity hosted on Amazon Elastic Cloud.
* My first projects, which were switched to Android Studio/Gradle and Material design.
* Used Google Play Services and Amazon GameCircle for achievements and leaderboards.
* Used fragments to show list and detail views together on tablet/landscape layouts.
* Worked hard to handle fragmentation, so the apps run on all kinds of phones and tablets without any problem.
