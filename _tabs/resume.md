## Experience

![daily-mirror](/assets/img/resume/daily-mirror.png){: width="167" height="62" .left }
### Reach plc, London
#### Senior Android developer, February 2021 – January 2024

* Influenced improvements on 50+ news applications, where the main challenge was making the design system and the build system work with all the variants, and keeping the build times to a minimum.
* Tech: Kotlin, Dagger/Hilt, MVI, MVIKotlin, JUnit, Espresso, Mockk, Realm, Coroutines, Bitbucket.
* Built new features to documentation, with code reviews and merge requests, in a full Agile environment: kanban sprints, code reviews, sprint planning, and retrospectives.
* Applied and enforced the use of a custom Material 2 design system. Planned out a migration to Compose with Material 3. Studied these with side projects.
* Helped junior members of the team with advice, reviews, and documentation. Documented every aspect of our processes, from Dagger how-tos, naming conventions, and design guidelines to the PR process.
* Led many migrations: Java to Kotlin, RxJava to Coroutines, SQLite to Realm, manual to Dagger dependency injection, and from various architectures to a single MVI one.
* Executed modularisation, and build process improvements, which resulted in 60% build time reduction, allowing us to stay on a cheaper CI tier, despite growth.
* Introduced many useful tools, such as Detekt, Gradle Version Catalog, plus many other Java tools and libraries replaced with Kotlin equivalents, which led to velocity improvements of 20-30%.
* The Extra Mile™: cleaned up the code regularly. The code went up from 80k Lines Of Code to 100k LOC during my tenure, but my estimate is that it would have been around 180k without my work, making it significantly more expensive to maintain.
