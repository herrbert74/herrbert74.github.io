Android developer since 2011. Have better than average skills in architecture and modularisation improvements, Android and general coding best practices, Gradle and Dagger. Can handle the whole development lifecycle and can lead others.

Iâ€™m passionate about clean and maintainable code, so I often take extra time to clean up what other people can't notice, like bad formatting, code duplication, and other hidden costs.

Tech used recently: Kotlin, MVI, Coroutines, SOLID, Dagger/Hilt, RetroFit, Jetpack Components, Modularisation, JUnit, Espresso, GraphQL, RxJava. On a hobby level: Jetpack Compose, Kotlin Multiplatform, iOS and SwiftUi.
